Tashikani is a Discord bot that helps you learn Japanese. learn new words, level your vocabulary, compete with your friends, and more.

The source code here is developing and educational purposes. I would recommend against running your own instance of this bot. Instead, use t!invite and click the [link](https://discord.gg/gFqhKcs2p8) to add the bot to your server.

## Contributing
